### Leaderboard

![leaderboard](http://cl.ly/image/211U1A033h3J)

Points are calculated this way:

- 5 points for completing tasks
- 15 points for getting your PRs merged

In order to get your PRs merged you need to setup a webhook in your repos that points to:

```
https://your.notdvs.installation.com/api/pull_request_mergers
```

The top person in the ladder will always have their bar full, and the others are calculated based on the top one.
