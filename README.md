### Leaderboard

There are currently two leaderboards: weekly and all time. The top person in the ladder will always have their bar full, and the other bars are calculated based on the top one.

Points are given according to the following rules.

#### Rules

Merging PRs:

- 100 points if the number of deletions is double the number of additions and it's greater than 1000
- 50 points if the number of additions is greater than 500
- 30 points if the number of deletions is double the number of additions and it's greater than 100
- 15 points if the number of additions is greater than 100
- 5 points if the number of additions is less than 10
- 10 points in all the other cases

Reviewing PRs:

- Half of the PR points for commenting with `:+1:`, `:thumbsup:`, `:shipit:`

#### Caveats

In order to get points for merging PRs you need to setup a webhook in your repos that points to:

```
https://your.lion.installation.com/api/pull_requests
```
